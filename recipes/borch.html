    <p> 2 Tbsp tomato sauce, or paste (or 3 Tbsp ketchup)</p>
    <p> 1 Tbsp butter </p>
    <p> 1 medium onion, finely diced </p>
    <p> 2 carrots, grated </p>
    <p> 2 large or 3 medium potatoes, peeled and sliced into bite-sized pieces </p>
    <p> 1/2 head of small cabbage, sliced </p>
    <p> 2 tomatoes, peeled and diced (**see note) </p>
    <p> 2 bay leaves </p>
    <p> 1/4 tsp freshly ground pepper </p>
    <p> 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley + more for garnish</p>
    <p> 2 cloves garlic, pressed</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li> Wash meat in cold water, cut into 1″ pieces and and place in 
a large soup pot with 14 cups cold water and 1 Tbsp salt. 
Bring it to a boil and remove the foam as soon as it boils
(if you wait, it will be hard to get rid of the foam as it
integrates into the broth and you’d have to strain it). </br></li>

        <li> Grate beets on the large grater holes (the food processor works amazingly well).
Place them in a large heavy-bottom skillet with 4 Tbsp
olive oil and 1 Tbsp vinegar and saute for 5 minutes,
then reduce heat to med/low and add 1 Tbsp sugar and 2 
Tbsp tomato sauce Mix thoroughly and saute until starting to soften, 
stirring occasionally (about 10 min). Remove from pan and set aside. <br></li>

             <li>In the same skillet (no need to wash it), Saute onion in 1 Tbsp 
butter for 2 min. Add grated carrot and sautee another 5 min or until softened,
adding more oil if it seems too dry. <br></li>

            <li>Once the meat has been cooking at least 45 min, place sliced potatoes into the soup pot and cook 10 min, 
then add cabbage, sauteed beets, onion & carrot, and chopped tomatoes.
Cook another 10 minutes or until potatoes can be easily pierced with a fork. <br></li>

        <li>Add 2 bay leaves, 1/4 tsp pepper, and more salt to taste (I added another 1/2 tsp salt). <br></li>

    <li>Chop parsley and pressed garlic then stir them into the soup pot, immediately cover and remove from heat.
Let the pot rest covered for 20 minutes for the flavors to meld. <br></li>
